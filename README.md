# SwiftUI Calculator

Welcome to the **SwiftUI Calculator**! This application is designed to provide a clean and efficient user experience for performing basic arithmetic operations. Built with SwiftUI, it leverages a structured architecture using models and views to organize the various components of the project. 

## Overview

The calculator utilizes multidimensional arrays (matrices) to manage the layout of its keys, ensuring that each button is positioned accurately within the graphical user interface (GUI). This approach not only simplifies the arrangement of the keys but also enhances the maintainability of the code.
